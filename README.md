# Auara_project for the development of solar water pumps  (IMH Elgoibar)


700 Million people lack adequate access to safe water. Solar water pumps 
can help, feel free to hack this project.

## Read this first

*In drought-affected areas of Africa, women must walk miles to find water, risking violence or animal 
attack, in order to sustain their families and animals. They do this with the knowledge that the dirty 
water they have collected may well make their children very ill.

Using the overabundance of sunshine,  solar pumps draw water from a 100-meter-deep well, providing 
families with the water that they need and rendering cases of water-related diseases a 
thing of the past.

* If you have an idea for a new feature, **submit your feature
  requests** to the [specification's repository](https://github.com/iarakistain/Auara_project/issues).

STL design file is included.


#### Electrical diagram

We have used mostly, components from SIEMENS in our design.

#### Automation SIEMENS PLC

We have used a SIEMES S7-1200 PLC.

#### LoRa sensor node

The code has been developed for a STM32 microcontroller, using ARDUINO. A T-BEAM board has been used for this purpose. The sketch sends 0-10V sensor data over LoRa every 30 seconds.

#### Dashboard

We have developed [this dashboard in TABLEAU](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bomba1/WaterPump1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes??:showVizHome=no) 

The location of the water pump in Tamarou, Benin [can be seen here](https://www.melown.com/cloud/link/1wMKtscRAQchNlIYUSC7)
